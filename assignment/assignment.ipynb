        "**ANSWERS TO QUESTION 1**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Rather than clean data, this paper is advocating for \"tidy\" data. It is a more structured, easily accessible way to interact with a data set. This further makes it easier to do analysis, etc.\n",
        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" tries to provide a standardized way to organize data. It's similar in language to relational database, but in more familiar language. It will allow for initial exploration and analysis of data while providing later easier development and analytics.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy data sets value standardization. Meanwhile, all data sets are messy but each have their own challenges a data scientist will need to manage. The second sentence means variable and observations can be fluid depending on the data set and context, so it is therefore difficult to precisely define those terms for all datasets.\n",
        "4. Values: some sort of qualitative or quantitative piece of data. Variable: the \"container\" that holds a value. One variable will always measure the same type of value. Observation: Contains all the values measured across a unit, e.g. a row in a table.\n",
        "5. Tidy Data has three qualities: Each variable forms a column, Each observation forms a row, Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6. \n",
        "    6a. 5 most common problems: The column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables being stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "    6b. The data in table 4 is messy because there are three distinct variables, yet those variables are not represented in the columns. Melting a dataset is essentially an unpivot. This is the turning the columns into rows.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because not each variable forms a column. The variable \"date\" is spread out among many columns which is unnecessary. Meanwhile, Table 12 consolidates each variable to its own column.\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem relates to the tidy data and tidy tools. Tidy data relies on tidy tools to utilize the data well. On the other hand, tidy tools can only exist if there exists tidy data. In the future, Wickham wants to incorporate other fields of study to make \"tidy data\" accessible to them as well. He also wants to look at topics like multidimensional arrays and other data cleaning tasks."
